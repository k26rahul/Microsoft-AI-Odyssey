I've been using it for 3 days now, So far so good. I'm impressed with how responsive the phone is. I like the ARC display, it doesn't work full time but works with spotify music. Battery life is good, it charges quickly. It went up from 50 to 100% in 15 minutes.

Recieved the product well packed, as a person who used a Samsung A70 for 5 years, this phone is a great refreshment and I am quite amazed with the quality, it feels like a premium phone for 16000 Rupees. If you need a backup phone, go for it.
